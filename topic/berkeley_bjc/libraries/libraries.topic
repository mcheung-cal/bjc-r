h2: Big Ideas
big-idea: Every programming language have resources that give it extra functionality
big-idea: Libraries in Snap! and Python, along with extensions in Snap! come in all different shapes and sizes
big-idea: Using these libraries and extensions can be extremely fun and rewarding!

h2: Activities
learning-goal: Learn what about libraries and extensions in programming
learning-goal: Use some of these libraries and extensions to learn about their capabilities
