    	<h3>Introduction to Colorama</h3>
      <p>
        One of the cool libraries that Python has is called Colorama. It's a great way to make your code look more fun by allowing you to print colored text in your terminal! 
      </p>
      <p>In this lab, you will learn the basic commands for changing the text color, background color, and dimming the brightness of text. You will then put it all together to analyze a text file and see the colorful output in your terminal! 
      </p>
      <p> This lab was developed by Rebecca Hu (2023) and Sage Jeon (2022). We hope you have fun!</p>
      <h3>Installation</h3>
      <p>Begin by installing the colorama library to your computer. Here are the ways you can do it for Mac or PC in your terminal:</p>
      <p>Mac:</p>
      <p><pre><code>
        
          python3 -m pip install colorama
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>PC:</p>
        <p><pre><code>
            py -m pip install colorama
        </code></pre></p>
        <h3>Starter Files</h3>

        <p>Download the starter file <a href = '/bjc-r/prog/python/colorama.zip'> using the link here.</a></p>
        <p>You will see that the lab comes with data from a text file (which is what you will be sorting and filtering through later), in addition to a starter code file named colorama_lab.py. In the code provided to you, you'll notice colorama needs to be initialized and the basic classes need to be imported using </p>
