<p>We have provided a starter file and imported and initialized all the functions you will need. 
</p>
<h3>Question 1:</h3>
<p>You will now write a function that takes in a string of text, and a string of color and prints the given text into the given color. Be sure to have your function set the text color back to default after changing it. 
</p>
<p>Hint: Think about the specific attributes that Fore has, how can you access attributes using another way besides dot notation? 
</p>

<h3>Question 2:</h3>
<p>Now try writing a function that takes in a string of text and prints the given text onto a given background color.  Be sure to have your function set the background color back to default after changing it. 
</p>

<h3>Question 3:</h3>
<p>Finally, write a function that takes in a string of text and prints the given text with the given level of brightness. Be sure to have your function set the brightness level back to default after changing it.  
</p>

<h3>Putting it all together:</h3>
<p>We have provided a text file for you to parse through and apply what you have learned to change the terminal display given conditions. </p>
<ol>
    <li>If the length of the word is greater than or equal to 6, change the color of the text to blue. 
    <li>If the word contains the letter 't', change the background color to yellow. 
    <li>If the word ends with the letter 'e', change the background color to green. 
    <li>If the word is a palindrome, change the brightness of the word to bright. 
</ol>

<p>Congratulations! Now you know how to make your terminal look pretty! </p>
