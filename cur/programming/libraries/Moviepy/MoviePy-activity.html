    	<h3>Making your own video</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you've been introduced to how MoviePy functions work, it's time to try these out yourself!
        Feel free to try these functions out on any of your own videos or videos you would like to try and edit.
        If you would like to try them out in another fun, challenging way, we have an exercise for you below! Just before that,
        here is a quick summary of all the functions you have read about, and a brief explanation of how they're used:
      </p>
      <h3>MoviePy Functions</h3>
      <pre><code>
# stores a video clip to a variable
clip1 = VideoFileClip("video1.mp4")

# accesses a specific segment of a clip
short_clip1 = clip1.subclip(10, 25)

# changes the volume of a clip
clip1 = clip1.volume(0.8)

# creates a new text clip
text_clip1 = TextClip("This is my new text clip!", fontsize=70, color='white')

# sets a specific time for the clip to start playing at when combined with other clips in a Composite Video Clip
clip1 = clip1.set_start(10)

# Plays multiple clips on top of one another or at the same time
# useful for text and audio clips being added
clip1 = VideoFileClip("video1.mp4")
text_clip1 = TextClip("This is my new text clip!", fontsize=70, color='white')
video1 = CompositeVideoClip([clip1, text_clip1])

# Writes and exports a chosen video file, saving it in the directory where the code is being run.
video1.write_videofile("my_new_movie.mp4")

# Change the speed or linearity of your chosen clip
clip1 = clip1.speedx(1.5) #speedx changes the speed of the clip
clip_reverse = clip1.fx(vfx.time_mirror) #makes the clip play backwards

# Change the color or size of your chosen clip
clip1 = clip1.resize(0.8) #changes the size of the clip
clip2 = clip1.fx(vfx.black_white) #makes the clip black and white

# Plays chosen clips one after another
complete_clip1 = concatenate_videoclips([clip1, clip2])

# Stacks clips and plays them in a table-like information
# Takes in an array of arrays (or a list of lists)
complete_clip2 = clips_array([[clip1], [clip2]])

      <h3>MoviePy - Video Task</h3>
      <p>
        In the starter files for this lab, we have provided you with 3 video files: video1.mp4, video2.mp4, video3.mp4. Using these very video files,
        we have created a brand new final_video.mp4 which is also available for you to view. Your task is to use
        the functions you have learned about to edit and put together these 3 videos to ultimately try and get as close
        as you can to the video we have created! If you haven't downloaded the starter files yet, you can download them from <a href="/bjc-r/prog/python/moviepy.zip">here</a>.
        We have provided some starter code as well as some hints in the file "moviepy_activity.py" but feel free to experiment and try to figure it out yourself!
      </p>
      <p class="alert alert-info quoteBlue">
          Note: You should definitely look back at the previous pages and refer to them if you are looking for a more in depth explanation
          of the various functions because there are quite a few! Also, this library is a lot of fun to just play around with so try it out
          by yourself and see what kinds of interesting videos you can create using everything you've learned about this library!
