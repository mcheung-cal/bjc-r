    </head>

    <p>Because Beetle Blocks is an extension of Snap!, it&apos;s functionalities are very similar to that of Snap!. Comparing the categories of blocks in each, you will see that there is a large degree of overlap between the two. The main differences between the two is the shapes category, which we will using in this lab. However, it should be noted that although the categories of blocks in these two programs are similar, Beetle Blocks does not contain all of the blocks that are present in Snap!</p>
