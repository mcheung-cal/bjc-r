    <p>Now you will try moving the sprite around in 3 dimensions. In the Motion tab, you will notice that the blocks are nearly identical to Snap! blocks. Every block that requires an axis input has options for x, y, and z axes. It should also be mentioned here that there is one rotate block rather than the two turn clockwise/counterclockwise blocks in Snap! The rotate block functions more similarly to the turn counterclockwise block. Try out the blocks to familiarize yourself with them and how they work.</p>

    <p>In the Shapes tab, the start drawing [lines] block and the stop drawing block function in the same way as the pen up and pen down block in Snap!</p>

    <p>Now, let&apos;s draw something simple in a 3D space. Try drawing a cube or making a cube block that draws the edges of a cube.</p>
