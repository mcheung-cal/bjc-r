    <p>Now that we have made simple line drawings, let&apos;s spice things up with more blocks from the Shapes tab. The cube, cuboid, sphere, and tube1 blocks create a shape in the location of your beetle.</p>

    <p>The start extruding [curves] and stop extruding blocks are another version of the drawing blocks. Extruding produces a three dimensional &quot;line&quot; as opposed to a thin line that is produced from drawing. Try drawing the cube from the last page using the extruding block. Is there a difference between using the curves option and the lines option on the start extruding block?</p>

    <p>Now, let&apos;s draw something simple in a 3D space. Try drawing a cube or making a cube block that draws the edges of a cube.</p>
