    	<h3>Snap To Python</h3>
      <p>
        Let us introduce a very interesting Snap! library that could be very useful in the future, in
        helping you learn python as a coding language, and something to help make the transition from
        Snap! to Python a little bit smoother. This library is (quite aptly) named Snap! To Python! and
        is a way for you to learn all the syntax of Python in a more visual coding language and environment
        such as Snap!.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main focus of this library is that it has custom blocks within Snap! that mimic and reflect the
        syntax and ordering of Python code, and so, could be used to get a better understanding of how a language
        like Python, can be represented as blocks too! Over the course of this lab, we will revisit some key
        functions and important topics you guys have covered in previous labs, and let you figure out the best
        way to rewrite these functions in Python syntax.
      </p>
      <p class="alert alert-info quoteBlue">
          Note: We obtained this library from Matthias Kim who completed the creation of the library, and the
          sole use of this library in CS10 should be for educational purposes and to highlight how such libraries
          can be useful to think about coding languages and problems in new ways.
