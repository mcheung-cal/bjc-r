    	<h3>Trying out the library</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you have some practice and have seen how the Snap To Python Library can be used with functions you've seen in the past,
        like the recursive 'numbers' block, here's another exercise to try and utilise python syntax and implementation for the recursive
        'merge' and 'sort' blocks you would have previously seen in the recursive reporters lab. To refresh your memory on what this block/code is
        meant to do, it takes in an unordered list of numbers, and returns a list with all the values in order. You can
        also find a link to the original page explaining the blocks
