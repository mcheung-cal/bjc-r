    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p>
        As you have learned from the Data Science lab, data science involves analyzing large datasets and drawing conclusions from them through exploration, prediction, and inference. DBSnap is a web application that will allow you to retrieve data from a data store and perform core Data Science operations such as filtering, merging, and aggregating tasks using blocks that were built using Snap!. You will be able to build database queries (based on relational algebra operators) using these blocks in a tree-based structure. This is actually very similar to queries that are done using SQL, a programming language that will be taught in CS61A and other upper division classes such as CS186 -- Intro to Database Systems.
