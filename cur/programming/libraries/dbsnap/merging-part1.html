    <h3>Union</h3>
    <p>The union operator is used to combine the query result of two SELECT statements. Try using SELECT on two student data sets to select only Junior and Seniors. It should look like this: </p>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/dbsnap/union_selection_hint.png" width="350" height="200" alt="preparing select queries for union query" /></p>
    <p>Now try to <b>UNION</b> these two queries. Does your <b>Query Result</b> only have Junior and Seniors?</p>

    <h3>Intersection</h3>
    <p>The <b>INTERSECTION</b> operator is used to combine the query result of two SELECT statements, but only returns the rows that exist in both of the SELECT query results. Try to find the intersection between the result of a Juniors only query and an AGE = 23 query. Your query result should look like this: </p>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/dbsnap/intersection_example_qresult.png" width="350" height="250" alt="query result of intersection query" /></p>
    <p>Your query should look like this:</p>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/dbsnap/intersection_example.png" width="300" height="250" alt="intersection query example" /></p>

    <h3>Exercise #2 Union and Intersection </h3>
    <p>Using the <b>UNION</b> and <b>INTERSECTION</b> blocks, along with your <b>SELECT</b> blocks, make a query that finds the Freshmen and Juniors that are 19 years old. There should be 6 entries in your Query Result. Remember to <b><u>save your query</u></b> if you want to keep it!</p>
    <p class="alert quoteBlue">
        Hint: The Union and Intersection blocks can be used on other queries too, not necessarily just SELECT statements.
