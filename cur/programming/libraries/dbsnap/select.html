    <h3>Select</h3>
    <p>Let&#39s make our first query! Using the <b>SELECT</b> operator on the <i>Students</i> data set. We want to only select the senior students. Your query should look like this:</p>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/dbsnap/Select_Juniors_Example.png" alt="select query that only selects juniors from students data set" /></p>
    <p>Your node result panel should look like this. If it isn&#39t showing up, try snapping on the SELECT node again. </p>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/dbsnap/Select_Juniors_QResult.png" alt="the query result of selecting only juniors from student data set" /></p>
    <p>You can also click on each node and see the result of that node in the <b><q>Node Result</q></b> panel. For example, clicking on the <b><q>Table Students</q></b> node will display the original data set that includes all grade levels, not just the selected ones.  </p>
